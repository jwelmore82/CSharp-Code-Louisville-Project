# CSharp-Code-Louisville-Project

My Code Louisville project for the C#/.NET Sept 2016 session

Rotating Chores is a web app that allows users to create a group of members and assign chores based on a difficulty level.
Once a chore is marked completed it will then be assigned to the next available member that is qualified to do the chore.

No special steps should be needed.  Just download, build, and run from Visual Studio.
